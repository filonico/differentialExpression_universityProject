This repository stores my final project for the university course "Laboratory of Comparative Genomics", held by prof. Fabrizio Ghiselli and dr. Mariangela Iannello, University of Bologna.

The main goal of the project was to perform a comparative analysis on already-published transcriptomic data, in order to learn some of the most-used assembly and differential expression analysis tools.

* [<code>project_repot.md</code>](./project_report.md) is the complete report, with commands, data and result presentation, of the project;
* [<code>scripts/</code>](./scripts/) contains R and bash scripts used in the project;
* [<code>mapping_statistics/</code>](./mapping_statistics/) contains files associated with mapping counts and figures;
* [<code>read_quality_check/</code>](./read_quality_check/) contains FASTQC html outputs;
* [<code>trimming_statitsics/</code>](./trimming_statitsics/) contains files associated with trimming statistics and figures.

Differential expression and GO annotation files were not uploaded because of their very large sizes.
