# Gene transcription responses of *Daphnia galeata* to the prolonged presence of natural predators
## Introduction
*Daphnia* is a genus of branchiopod crustaceans belonging to the sub-order Cladocera (order Diplotraca) and comprises the so-called water fleas. Daphniids exhibit a folded (‘bivalve’) carapace that encloses the entire trunk (but not the cephalon as it does in other diplostracans) and serves mainly as a brood chamber (Brusca et al., 2016). Water fleas are distributed worldwide in freshwater basins and ponds where they play a key role as bioindicators of environmental health and quality (Miyakawa et al., 2010 and references therein). In addition, *Daphnia pulex* is the first crustacean sensu stricto to have had its genome sequenced and, together with other congeneric species, now counts on a personal genome web-database, the [wFleaBase](http://wfleabase.org/) (Colbourne et al., 2005).
Besides genomics and ecotoxicology, water fleas have become also good models to study developmental processes and their interactions with environment, in the modern context of the Eco-Evo-Devo (ecological evolutionary developmental biology). As a matter of fact, *Daphnia* spp. show the capacity to form defensive morphological structures (such as the helmets of *Daphnia cucullata* and *Daphnia longispina* and the neck teeth of *Daphnia pulex*; Tams et al., 2020) in response to the detection of non-lethal chemical cues (named kairomoes) from predators. These morphological defenses in *Daphnia*, also known as predator-induced polyphenisms (Miyakawa et al., 2010), act by lowering the capture success of predators and exhibit a transgen-erational effect too (Agrawal et al., 1999).

In this work, a differential expression analysis of one clone of *Daphnia galeata* were performed in order to address the genetic response and basis of this water flea species to the exposure of fish kairomones. *Daphnia galeata* shows in fact life history trait (such as the age at first reproduction, the somatic growth rate and the body length) variations in populations grown up in the presence of fish kairomones, but not severe morphological changes (Tams et al., 2018, 2020).
