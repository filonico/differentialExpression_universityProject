This repository stores my final project for the university course "Laboratory of Comparative Genomics", held by prof. Fabrizio Ghiselli and dr. Mariangela Iannello, University of Bologna.

The main goal of the project was to perform a comparative analysis on already-published transcriptomic data, in order to learn some of the most-used assembly and differential expression analysis tools.
